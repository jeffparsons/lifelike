Conway's Game of Life on arbitrary cells.

It takes images as input.

And produces images as output.

Or it can display its results in a window.

It's not very fun right now. Don't get your hopes up, either, because it's unlikely to become fun any time soon. But really, what did you expect from a [zero-player game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)?


Building / running
------------------

To run the standard cartesian grid Game of Life in a window:

```
./run_interactive.sh
```

To generate output frames for all the example input files with some reasonable rule sets:

```
./run_examples.sh
```
